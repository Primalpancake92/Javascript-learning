To interact with the HTML DOM, we must have an HTML document available. For instance:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>JavaScript DOM</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello DOM!</h1>
  </body>
</html>

There is a hierachy within this document, and it forms a tree, where the nodes are 
the tags, the HTML document is the root, the children nodes beneath a parent node,
and the and set of nodes are at a level of hierarchy. 

Now JavaScript is a powerful tool that is a part of the DOM that allows for the 
manipulation and modification of HTML elements. These are given in the form of 
functions and methods, which are often called the HTML DOM Application Programming
Interface (API).
